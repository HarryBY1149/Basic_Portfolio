            <p> My name is Harry Young and I am a fledgling full stack web developer. I studied coding at the Penn LPS coding bootcamp. I am an avid reader, musician, cook and gamer.</p>
            <p> I was a restaurant professional for twelve years before making the leap into the wonderful world of coding.  Those twelve years taught me a number of skills that translate well to my new vocation, problem solving chief among them.  I bring the focus, dedication, and off the cuff creativity of the kitchen to every project I work on.</p>
